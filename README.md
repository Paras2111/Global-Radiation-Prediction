# Global-Radiation-Prediction
Over the years, fossil fuels have been humankindâ€™s main energy source. Let it be for powering
our homes, industries or running automobiles, we have burned away fossil fuels at alarming
rates. This has lead to deterioration of the environment and has had very detrimental effects.

This project aims to optimise solar energy productions. This is being done by making
predictions about future values of the Clearsky Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Clearsky
Diffused Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and the Clearsky Diffused Normal Irradiance (DNI) in a
region over several intervals of time. All of these predictions can help us locate solar plants
efficiently.

The above task is achieved by using Multi Variant Time series forecasting. The model takes
several variables as inputs and based on that makes predictions about the above values. These
are made using a particular architecture of RNNs known as LSTMs.
